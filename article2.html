            May 08, 2023 | BY SARAH MITCHELL
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-image">
            <strong>IMAGE 1:</strong> Elderly woman (70s) sitting at kitchen table, head in hands, devastated and overwhelmed, surrounded by bills and papers.
        </div>
        <p class="image-caption">Linda Patterson, 73, never imagined she'd spend her husband's funeral week begging her children for money.</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>The clock showed 6:47 AM when Linda Patterson got the call. Her husband James—her partner of 51 years—had passed away from a sudden stroke.</p>
            
            <p>By 9:15 AM, a funeral director was sitting at her kitchen table with a price list. The total? <strong>$13,400.</strong> She had 48 hours to arrange payment.</p>
            
            <p>Linda checked her accounts. Checking: $2,847. Savings: $8,200. <strong>She was $2,400 short.</strong></p>
            
            <p>That meant calling her three children—who were grieving their father—and asking them for money. Her daughter has two kids in college. Her son just bought a house. Her youngest is drowning in student loans.</p>
            
            <p><strong>By Wednesday, Linda had emptied her entire savings and borrowed $2,400 from her children.</strong> James got the funeral he deserved, but Linda was left with $847 in her checking account.</p>
            
            <p>"For months, I lived in terror," Linda admits. "One funeral took away 40 years of savings."</p>
            
            <h2>The One Thing That Could Have Changed Everything</h2>
            
            <p>Four months later, Linda's sister Carol told her something that made her want to cry all over again.</p>
            
            <p>When Carol's husband died two years earlier, she made one phone call to an insurance company. <strong>Within 24 hours, $15,000 was in her bank account.</strong> No paperwork. No waiting. She paid the funeral home that same day.</p>
            
            <p>Carol's husband had Final Expense Coverage. It cost $58 a month—less than cable TV. Over eight years, he paid about $5,600 in premiums. When he died, Carol got $15,000 in 24 hours.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>"Fifty-eight dollars a month. That's what stood between me having peace of mind and living in financial terror. We never even knew this existed."</p>

                <h3>No Medical Exam Required</h3>
                <p>You answer a few health questions over the phone—that's it. High blood pressure? Diabetes? Previous heart attack? Most applicants still qualify.</p>
                <p><em>"I have arthritis, high cholesterol, and blood pressure medication," Linda says. "I thought I'd never qualify. None of that mattered."</em></p>

                <p>The rate you're quoted never increases. Not when you get older. Not when you get sick. Most seniors pay $30-$80 per month depending on age and coverage.</p>
                <p><em>"I pay $58 a month now," Linda says. "In 10 years, still $58. It never goes up."</em></p>

                <h3>Money Paid Within 24 Hours</h3>
                <p><strong>This is the game-changer.</strong> Your family makes ONE phone call. Within 24 hours, the money is in their account. No probate. No paperwork. No delays.</p>
                <p><em>"My sister called on Friday," Linda explains. "Saturday morning, $15,000 was in her account."</em></p>

                <h3>Instant Approval (Ages 50-85)</h3>
                <p>Most people get approved in 10-15 minutes. No waiting weeks. No complicated applications. One phone call. Instant approval.</p>
                <p><em>"I was on the phone for 12 minutes," Linda says. "Eight questions. Approved before I hung up."</em></p>

                <p><strong>$10,000 in coverage typically runs $40-$65 per month</strong> for someone in their 60s or 70s. Less than cable. Less than eating out twice a month.</p>

            <h2>Why Waiting Costs You More</h2>
            
            <p>Here's the truth: <strong>every year you wait, coverage gets more expensive—or you might not qualify at all.</strong></p>
            
            <p>A healthy 65-year-old might pay $45/month for $10,000 in coverage. That same person at 72? It's $75/month. At 78? Over $100.</p>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
            <h4>⏰ The Cost of Waiting Just One Year:</h4>
            <p>A 68-year-old who waits until 69 will pay <strong>$180-$240 MORE per year</strong> for the same coverage. Over 10 years, that's <strong>$1,800-$2,400 wasted.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Worse: most policies have a two-year waiting period for natural causes. <strong>If you wait until you're sick, your family might not get the full benefit.</strong></p>
