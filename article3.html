        <p class="subheadline">If you're worried about burdening your children with funeral costs, there's a solution. It pays in 24 hours, requires no medical exam, and costs less than cable TV.</p>

            May 08, 2023 | BY SARAH MITCHELL
        </div>
        
           <img src="11.png"  class="article-image"    />
        <p class="image-caption">Linda Patterson never imagined funeral costs would destroy 40 years of savings in 72 hours.</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>When Linda Patterson's husband died suddenly, a funeral director showed up with a bill for <strong>$13,400.</strong> She had 48 hours to pay.</p>
            
            <p>Her checking account: $2,847. Savings: $8,200. <strong>She was $2,400 short.</strong></p>
            
            <p>By Wednesday, Linda had emptied every account and borrowed from her three children—who were grieving and struggling with their own bills.</p>
            
            <p>"I spent 40 years building that safety net," Linda says. "One funeral, and it was gone."</p>
            
            <h2>What She Didn't Know (But Wishes She Had)</h2>
            
            <p>Four months later, Linda's sister told her something devastating.</p>
            
            <p>When her sister's husband died, she made <strong>one phone call.</strong> Within 24 hours, <strong>$15,000 was in her bank account.</strong> She paid the funeral home that same day. No stress. No borrowing. No panic.</p>
            
            <p>Her husband had Final Expense Coverage. Cost? <strong>$58 a month—less than cable TV.</strong></p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>"Fifty-eight dollars a month would have saved me from a year of financial terror. I never even knew this existed."</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>What Makes Final Expense Coverage Different:</h3>
            
            <p><strong>✓ No Medical Exam:</strong> Just answer a few health questions over the phone. High blood pressure? Diabetes? Most still qualify.</p>
            
            <p><strong>✓ Rate Locked Forever:</strong> Your rate never increases. Ever. Most seniors pay $30-$80/month.</p>
            
            <p><strong>✓ Paid in 24 Hours:</strong> Your family makes ONE call. Money in their account the next day. No probate. No delays.</p>
            
            <p><strong>✓ Instant Approval:</strong> Most people approved in 10-15 minutes over the phone. Ages 50-85.</p>
            
            <p><strong>✓ More Affordable Than You Think:</strong> $10,000 coverage typically costs $40-$65/month for seniors.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">"Now my children won't have to scramble for money while they're grieving."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why Waiting Costs You More (Or Worse)</h2>
            
            <p>Every year you wait, rates go up. A 65-year-old might pay $45/month. At 72? $75/month. At 78? Over $100.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Wait one year and you'll pay $180-$240 MORE annually for the same coverage.</strong> Over 10 years, that's $1,800-$2,400 wasted.</p>
            
            <p>Worse: wait until you're sick and you might not qualify at all. Then your family faces what Linda faced.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>"The call took 12 minutes. Twelve minutes that would have saved me a year of hell."</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Linda finally made the call six months later. She was 73 with high blood pressure. <strong>Approved in 12 minutes. $58/month for $12,000 coverage.</strong></p>
            
            <p>"My kids know everything is handled now," she says. "When my time comes, they make one call and $12,000 is in their account within 24 hours. <strong>They get to grieve instead of scrambling for money.</strong>"</p>
            
            <p>Her advice to other seniors?</p>
            
            <p><strong>"Stop waiting. Pick up the phone today. James and I waited, and it cost me everything. Don't make my mistake."</strong></p>
