    <h1>Why Every American Over 50 Should Claim the $25,000 Burial Protection Plan at the Earliest</h1>
    <div class="image-placeholder">[Insert Relevant Image Here]</div>
    <p>If you're over 50 and haven’t planned for this yet, you're risking leaving behind more than grief. You could be leaving behind a $25,000 bill your family can’t afford.</p>

    <h2>The $25,000 Surprise Waiting at Every Funeral Home</h2>
    <div class="image-placeholder">[Funeral or Family Image Placeholder]</div>
    <p>I thought losing my dad would be the hardest part. I was wrong. It wasn’t the funeral itself. It was watching my mom’s hands shake as the funeral home handed us the $11,400 invoice. We didn’t have the money. My sister maxed out her credit card. We argued about flowers. About the casket. About what he “would’ve wanted” vs. what we could afford. That day changed how I see everything.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Families fighting in their lobby.</li>
      <li>Tears turning to blame.</li>
      <li>Credit cards swiped in desperation.</li>
      <li>People choosing cremation not because they want it—but because it’s all they can afford.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>“We’ll Figure It Out Later” Is Not a Plan</h2>
    <div class="image-placeholder">[Decision-Making Image Placeholder]</div>
    <p>Most people don’t want to think about their own funeral. But ignoring it doesn’t make it cheaper. It just leaves your loved ones to make impossible choices while they’re already grieving.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take out loans?</li>
      <li>Borrow from family?</li>
      <li>Choose the cheapest option and feel guilty forever?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Is the $25,000 Burial Protection Plan?</h2>
    <div class="image-placeholder">[Insurance/Protection Image Placeholder]</div>
    <p>It’s a final expense insurance plan made for Americans over 50.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pays up to $25,000 to cover funeral costs, burial or cremation, medical bills, and unpaid debts.</li>
      <li>Payout typically within 24 hours of your passing—so your family isn’t left waiting.</li>
      <li>No medical exam required—just answer a few simple questions.</li>
      <li>Rates never increase—lock it in now and it stays the same for life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Act Now?</h2>
    <p>Because funerals aren’t getting cheaper. Because every year you wait, you risk higher costs or fewer options. Because your health can change overnight—and then you might not qualify at all. Because locking it in early guarantees your family peace when they need it most.</p>

    <h2>The Benefits Your Family Will Thank You For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No surprise bills.</li>
      <li>No late-night arguments about money.</li>
      <li>No stress over credit cards or loans.</li>
      <li>No shame explaining to the funeral director you can’t afford what you want.</li>
      <li>Just the chance to say goodbye with dignity, love, and peace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Give Them the Goodbye They Deserve</h2>
    <div class="image-placeholder">[Family/Farewell Image Placeholder]</div>
    <p>Because one day, they’ll be standing there. In that room. With the funeral director. And the only question will be: Did you make this easier for them? Or did you leave them with a choice between debt and regret?</p>

    <div class="cta">
      <p><strong>Check If You Qualify in Just 60 Seconds</strong></p>
